# Quickstart Guide

Get soldering in 15 minutes. Seriously.

## The Truth About Getting Started

You do not need a $500 setup to learn electronics. You need about $60 worth of basic tools and the willingness to try. That is it.

This guide will get you from zero to making your first solder joint today.

## What You Actually Need to Start

Here is the honest minimum for your electronics lab:

| Item | What to Get | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| Soldering iron | Any with temperature control | $40-50 |
| Solder | 60/40 or 63/37, 0.8mm diameter | $5-8 |
| Tip cleaner | Brass ball cleaner | $5-8 |
| Something to practice on | Old electronics or a cheap kit | $0-10 |

**Total: about $50-75**

That is it. You can add more later, but this gets you started today.

## The One Thing Everyone Gets Wrong

New solderers always try to melt the solder with the iron tip. This creates ugly, weak joints.

**The right way:** Heat the joint (the metal parts you want to connect), then let the hot joint melt the solder. The solder flows toward heat.

Think of it like this: you are heating up the metal so it can grab onto the solder, not dripping solder onto cold metal.

## Your First Solder Joint

Here is the actual process:

1. **Clean your tip** - Wipe it on the brass cleaner
2. **Touch the iron to the joint** - Make contact with both the pad and the wire/component lead
3. **Count to 3** - Let the heat transfer
4. **Feed in solder** - Touch solder to the joint (not the iron tip)
5. **Pull away solder** - When you see enough flow onto the joint
6. **Pull away iron** - Do not disturb it
7. **Wait 3 seconds** - Let it cool without moving anything

## What Good Looks Like

A good solder joint is:

- Shiny (for leaded solder) or slightly satin (lead-free)
- Shaped like a small volcano - slopes up to meet the wire
- Smooth, no bumps or cracks

A bad solder joint is:

- Dull and grainy (cold joint - not enough heat)
- Blobby and round (too much solder)
- Has cracks (moved while cooling)

The good news: bad joints are easy to fix. Just reheat them.

## Temperature Settings

If your iron has temperature control:

| Solder Type | Temperature |
|-------------|-------------|
| Leaded (60/40, 63/37) | 320-350C / 610-660F |
| Lead-free | 370-400C / 700-750F |

Start with leaded solder. It is much easier to work with. Lead-free requires more heat and is less forgiving.

---

## What to Practice On

Before you solder anything important:

1. **Old electronics** - Find broken remotes, toys, anything. Practice desoldering and resoldering components.

2. **Practice kits** - Search for "soldering practice kit" online. They are $5-15 and designed for learning.

3. **Header pins** - Buy a cheap microcontroller board (Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino Nano) and solder the header pins.

## When You Are Ready for More

Once you have made a few joints and feel comfortable:

**Add these tools to your electronics workstation:**

- Multimeter ($20) - Test your circuits
- Flux ($8) - Makes solder flow better
- Solder wick ($5) - Fixes mistakes
- Tweezers ($10) - Holds small parts
- Helping hands ($15) - Holds your board

## Common First-Timer Problems

| Problem | What is Happening | Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| Solder will not stick | Surface is dirty or oxidized | Clean with alcohol, add flux |
| Joint looks dull/grainy | Did not get hot enough | Reheat it |
| Made a bridge | Too much solder | Use solder wick to remove excess |
| Burnt the board | Too hot or too long | Lower temp, work faster |

## Go Build Something

You now know enough to start. The best way to learn is by doing.

Pick up an iron, find something to practice on, and make some joints. They will not be perfect. That is fine. Every solderer started with ugly joints.
