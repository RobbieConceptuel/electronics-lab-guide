Electronics is a foundational skill. Whether you are building prototypes, repairing equipment, or developing embedded systems, it starts with understanding circuits and knowing how to solder.

This guide will teach you both from your first solder joint to a fully equipped home lab.

**No experience needed. No expensive equipment. Just you and a $50 starter kit.**

## What You Will Learn

This guide takes you from zero to building real electronics projects:

| Step | What You Learn |
|------|----------------|
| 1 | How to solder (your first joint in 15 minutes) |
| 2 | What tools to buy (without wasting money) |
| 3 | How to set up your electronics lab |
| 4 | How to read components and schematics |
| 5 | How to build functional circuits |

---

## Start Here

**New to electronics?** Start with the [Quickstart Guide](QUICKSTART.md).

You will make your first solder joint in about 15 minutes. All you need is ~$50 in basic tools.

---

## Who Is This For?

This guide is for you if:

- You have never soldered before
- You are building Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or embedded systems projects
- You are setting up your first electronics lab or workshop
- You want to prototype and test your own circuits
- You need to repair or modify electronic equipment
- You are a student learning electronics fundamentals

**You do NOT need:**

- An engineering degree
- Expensive tools
- Any previous experience

---

## What Tools Do I Need?

You can start with about $50-75. Here is the minimum:

| Tool | Why You Need It | Cost |
|------|-----------------|------|
| Soldering iron (temp control) | Melts solder to join components | $40-50 |
| Solder wire (60/40, 0.8mm) | The metal that joins everything | $5-8 |
| Brass tip cleaner | Keeps your iron working well | $5-8 |
| Practice kit | Something to learn on | $0-10 |

That is it. You can add more later.

## Common Questions

**Is soldering difficult?**
No. Most people produce clean joints within an hour of practice. The technique is straightforward once you understand heat transfer.

**Is it safe?**
A soldering iron operates at 300-400C, so basic precautions are required. Millions of engineers and hobbyists work safely at home. Proper ventilation and handling are covered in this guide.

**How much space do I need?**
A desk or workbench is sufficient. You do not need a dedicated room to start.

**Leaded or lead-free solder?**
Start with leaded (60/40 or 63/37). It has better flow characteristics and is more forgiving for beginners. Wash hands after use and work in a ventilated area.
