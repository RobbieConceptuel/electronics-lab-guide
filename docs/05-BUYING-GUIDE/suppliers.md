# Suppliers

Where to buy electronics tools and components.

---

## General Strategy

- **Expensive tools** - Buy from reputable sellers with return policies
- **Cheap tools and supplies** - AliExpress is fine, just expect to wait
- **Components** - Depends on urgency and quantity

---

## For Tools and Equipment

### Amazon

**Good for:** Fast delivery, easy returns, brand-name tools

**Watch out for:** Counterfeits on some brands

Most of the tools in this guide are available on Amazon with reasonable prices and fast shipping.

### AliExpress

**Good for:** Budget tools, bulk supplies, things you can wait for

**Watch out for:** 2-4 week shipping, variable quality

Great for: silicone mats, tweezers, helping hands, practice kits, consumables.

### Banggood

Similar to AliExpress. Sometimes has better prices, sometimes worse. Worth checking both.

## For Components

### DigiKey, Mouser, Farnell

**Good for:** Guaranteed authentic parts, huge selection, datasheets

**Watch out for:** Shipping costs on small orders, minimum quantities

These are the professional sources. Parts are real, datasheets are linked, and you can trust what you are getting.

### LCSC

**Good for:** Cheap components, especially if ordering PCBs from JLCPCB

**Watch out for:** Longer shipping from China

Great prices, especially for passive components and common ICs.

### AliExpress

**Good for:** Cheap components when you do not need guaranteed authenticity

**Watch out for:** Counterfeits, especially on ICs and sensors

Fine for resistors, capacitors, LEDs, connectors. Risky for anything programmable or complex.

## For PCBs

### JLCPCB

The default choice for hobby PCBs. Cheap, good quality, reasonable shipping.

5 boards for about $2 plus shipping. Add assembly service for SMD parts.

### PCBWay

Similar to JLCPCB. Sometimes better for special requirements.

### Aisler (Europe)

European option with faster shipping to EU countries.

---

## For Microcontrollers and Dev Boards

### Official Sources

- Raspberry Pi: rpilocator.com to find stock
- Arduino: arduino.cc or authorized distributors
- Adafruit, SparkFun: Direct from their websites

### Amazon

Good for: Quick delivery on common boards

Watch out for: Clones sold as originals (though clones often work fine for learning)

### AliExpress

Good for: Cheap clone boards for learning and experimentation

Perfectly fine for learning. Buy official when you need support or guaranteed quality.

## Price Comparison Tips

1. **Check multiple sources** - Prices vary significantly
2. **Factor in shipping** - Free shipping thresholds matter
3. **Consider time** - Is saving $10 worth waiting 3 weeks?
4. **Buy consumables in bulk** - Solder, flux, wick are always needed

---

## Trusted Stores on AliExpress

Some stores have better reputations:

- KSGER Official Store (soldering equipment)
- UNI-T Official Store (meters and tools)
- FNIRSI Official Store (test equipment)

Look for stores with good ratings and "Official Store" designation.
